# Tilde: ~ is where the â™¥ is

Various configuration files ("dotfiles") and scripts from my home directory. I
use this on new computers so I feel more at home.

## Quickstart

To install, execute:
```Shell
git clone https://github.com/thedahm/tilde.git && tilde/install.sh`
```

To update an existing install, go to Tilde's directory and execute:
```Shell
git pull && ./install.sh`
```
